## 👋 Hi, I'm Marta Truszczyńska

I'm a junior year high school student from Poland, aspiring to become a researcher in the future.  
I'm passionate about **biotechnology**, **computer science**, and especially **bioinformatics** — I love exploring the intersection between biology and technology.

I have experience with **Python**, which I use to automate tasks, analyze data, and solve problems.

In my free time, I enjoy:
- 🧪 Homelabbing and experimenting with tech setups
- 🕵️‍♀️ Solving CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges
- 💻 Learning new technologies and diving deep into how things work

Always curious, always learning. Let's build something cool together!
